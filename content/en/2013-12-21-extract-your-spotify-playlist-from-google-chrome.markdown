Hi guys,

finally it's time for me for some rest, Christmas is coming and all we're happy to pass some time with our parents, friends and the people who we love :)

But also, it's time to rock with something new, don't we? Of course we do! And let's bring to the scene this brand new extension for Chrome which I developed this last week. Actually this was borned while I was watching a friend video about on [how to import Spotify Songs into the new iTunes Cloud](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn1XHATQThc). And well, I tought "wait, why aren't we exporting it from the brand new [Spotify web player](https://play.spotify.com/)?".

And this is what I did. I built this nice extension which will guide on exporting with a 1-click solution your playlists without any painful process.

Go [get it right now into the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spotify-playlist-extracto/onglffcjldphmpfnpdfmngfenhmjlnnn) and enjoy this Christmas, with another Freedom-maker tool :)
Oh, of course it is [Open Source](https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/spotify-playlist-extractor)Â and you can find it as always into my GitHub!

So, thanks for reading as always and I hope we'll get the next year, with awesome new findings and cool tools.

Marry Christmas and a Happy New Year!
