Hi all again,

those days are pretty much active for me. I've got really no time of doing nothing, but today i've got a special gift for you :) I'm proud of this and i'm talking about [Youtube Live Feed jQuery Plugin](https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/jquery-youtubelivefeed "Youtube Live Feed jQuery Plugin at GitHub")!

This plugin will let you get the the live feed you're boradcasting in your Youtube Channel, but not also this, it will tell you if yor're online and the comments under your video. But it's not finished, it will also give you your latest live video you've recorder the last time you was live, and all of this, "automagically" for you :)

I hope you'll like it as much as i loved it while i was developing it.Â By the way, here's a [demo](http://delirinotturni.org/live/ "Deliri Notturni Live Page") link where this plugin is actually used.

Enjoy :)
