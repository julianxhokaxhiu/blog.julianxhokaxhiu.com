Hi,

today i would like you to present this little plugin i've made for you, and I'm of course talking about [jQuery iTunes Store Search Plugin](https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/jquery-itunestoresearch "jQuery iTunes Store Search Plugin").

## What it is?

It's a wrapper to [Apple Search API](http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/resources/documentation/itunes-store-web-service-search-api.html "Apple Search API") which can easily query iTunes Store, Mac App Store, App Store or iBooks Store directly from jQuery. Useful if you would like to make your simple interface for searching apps within your page, or for example embedding your apps in your website.

## Where you can I find it?

As always in my GitHub!

## That's all!

Really? Yes :) Thanks for reading, I hope you'll enjoy it!
