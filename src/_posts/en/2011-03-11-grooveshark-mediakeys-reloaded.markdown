Hi there,

just want to share with you my new work that i have made. I'm talking about a Google Chrome extensions that is called Grooveshark Mediakeys Reloaded.

What you can do with it? Simple! It allows you to use your Keyboard Multimedia Keys with Grooveshark, from the tab itself, from the other tabs but also if Grooveshark is in a separeted window (like a Web App). So you will forget forever about Grooveshark as a Web App with those click limitations. Just use your multimedia keys like you just already do with iTunes or Windows Media Player.

Where you can download this? Just point your browser here: [https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jaicdopiaemahiofpemoljckbebcpcjm](https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/jaicdopiaemahiofpemoljckbebcpcjm)

Like i always, i post my code snippet. This time i sugget you to download it and see it from there, just because i can also update it, so you will always see the code evolving from there. If you're a developer, just like me, you know how to do it ;)

Thanks for reading, i hope you'll enjoy this.
